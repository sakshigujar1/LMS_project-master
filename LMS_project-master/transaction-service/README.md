## Overview
-  The Borrowing Service is responsible for handling book loan and return operations in the Library Management System. It maintains borrowing history for each member, checks borrowing eligibility, and updates book availability. This service integrates with Book and Member services and registers with Eureka for service discovery.

## Features
- Borrow a book by a registered member
- Return a borrowed book
- Validate borrow limits or book availability
- View borrowing history by member
- Track active vs. returned borrow records

##  Layered Architecture per Microservice
Each service follows a standard 3-layered architecture pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns and long-term scalability:

**Controller Layer**  
  `BorrowingController`: Exposes endpoints for issuing and returning books  
  â†’ `/api/borrow`, `/api/return`

- **Service Layer**  
  `BorrowingService`, `BorrowingServiceImpl`: Manages due dates, availability checks, and triggers fine calculation

- **Repository Layer**  
  `BorrowingRepository`: Tracks all borrow/return records per member and book
