## Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a RESTful API-based backend application designed to manage book collections, member registrations, borrowing and returning of books, overdue tracking, and notifications. It is built using Spring Boot and supports relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

##  Module Overview

The Library Management System is built using a microservices architecture. Each module handles a specific business capability and communicates via REST APIs. Below is a quick summary:

### Book Service
Handles the library's book catalog. Responsible for adding, updating, searching, and listing books, along with managing availability status (e.g., available, issued, reserved).
- [Book Service](./book-service/README.md)

### Member Service
Manages all library members: registration, updates, lookups, and status changes. Exposes endpoints to search and retrieve member details and supports member lifecycle management.
- [Member Service](./member-service/README.md)

### Borrowing Service
Manages the issuance and return of books by members. Ensures book availability, tracks due dates, and maintains borrowing history. Coordinates with both Member and Book services.
- [Borrowing Service](./borrowing-service/README.md)
###  Fine Service
Calculates and manages overdue fines for borrowed books. It tracks return deadlines, applies configurable penalty rules, and exposes endpoints for querying outstanding dues. Integrates with the Borrowing Service to detect overdue returns and can trigger notifications via the Notification Service.
- [Fine Service](./fine-service/README.md)

###  Notification Service
Sends alerts and reminders to users. Used to notify members about upcoming due dates, overdue returns, registration confirmations, and system messages (via email, SMS, etc.).
- [ Notification Service](./notification-service/README.md)
  
### API Gateway
Provides a unified entry point to route incoming client requests to appropriate microservices. Also handles load balancing, logging, and cross-cutting concerns.
Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

###  Discovery Server (Eureka)
Acts as a service registry where all microservices register themselves. Enables dynamic service discovery and communication within the ecosystem.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LMS
   ```
2. Configure the database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lmsdb
   spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
   spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```
3. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

## Testing
Run the tests using Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```
---

## Deployment
1. **Build the Application**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
   This generates a JAR file in the `target/` directory.

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/LMS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Set the following environment variables for production:
   ```bash
   export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
   export DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mysql://<production-db-url>:3306/lmsdb
   export DATABASE_USERNAME=<your-username>
   export DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory. Use the following command to view logs in real-time:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/lms-production.log
   ```
